Subset Sums
Basic Accuracy: 64.85% Submissions: 7551 Points: 1

Given a list arr of N integers, print sums of all subsets in it. Output should be printed in increasing order of sums.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
arr[] = {2, 3}
Output:
0 2 3 5
Explanation:
When no elements is taken then Sum = 0.
When only 2 is taken then Sum = 2.
When only 3 is taken then Sum = 3.
When element 2 and 3 are taken then
Sum = 2+3 = 5.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 3
arr = {5, 2, 1}
Output:
0 1 2 3 5 6 7 8

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function subsetSums() which takes a list/vector and an integer N as an input parameter and return the list/vector of all the subset sums in increasing order.

Expected Time Complexity: O(2N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(2N)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 15
0 <= arr[i] <= 10000
