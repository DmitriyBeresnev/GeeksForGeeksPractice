Restricted Pacman
Medium Accuracy: 89.24% Submissions: 2189 Points: 4

In the game of Restricted Pacman, an infinite linear path is given. Pacman has to start at position 0 and eat as many candies as possible. In one move he can only jump a distance of either M or N.  If M and N are coprime numbers, find how many candies will be left on the board after the game is over.
Note: The result is always finite as after a point X every index in the infinite path can be visited.

Example 1:

Input: M = 2, N = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: From index 0, the indices that
can be visited are
0 + 2 = 2
0 + 2 + 2 = 4
0 + 5 = 5
0 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 6
0 + 2 + 5 = 7
0 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8
0 + 2 + 2 + 5 = 9
0 + 5 + 5 = 10
and so on.
1 and 3 are the only indices that cannot be
visited. Therefore the candies at these two
positions will be left on the board.


Example 2:

Input: M = 2, N = 7
Output: 3

Example 3:

Input: M = 25, N = 7
Output: 72

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function candies() which take M and N as input parameters and return the answer.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 < M, N â‰¤ 500

Frobenius Number and Coin Problem
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_problem

Even if you don't know anything about Frobenius Number and Coin Problem, you can solve it with an algorithm using a Hashset:

Hashset will represent the set of candies which can be eaten.
Add M, N into Hashset.
Loop with every integer I, starting from min(M, N) + 1 {
	if Hashset contains either I - M or I - N {
		add I into Hashset.
		if I is added "min(M, N)" times consecutively, We're sure there will be no more candies left uneaten afterwards.
		The total amount of uneaten candies is I - "size of Hashset".
	}
}


int candies(int m, int n) {
    vector<bool> dp(m * n + 1, false);
    dp[0] = true;
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= m * n; i++) {
        if (i >= m)dp[i] = dp[i] | dp[i - m];
        if (i >= n)dp[i] = dp[i] | dp[i - n];
        if (!dp[i])ans++;
    }
    return ans;
}


static int candies(int m, int n)
   {

       int maxRange = lcm(m, n);

       HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

       map.put(0, 1);


       int count = 0;

       for(int i = 1; i < maxRange; i++)
       {
           if(map.containsKey(i - n) || map.containsKey(i - m))
           {
               map.put(i, 1);
           }
           else
           {
               count += 1;
           }
       }
